                Sligo Rovers has a 17.3 million euro plan to upgrade the stadium by 2028
            </h2>
            <p>
                Sligo Rovers have today published a detailed Master plan, including a proposed multi-million euro redevelopment of the Showgrounds stadium with the creation of an academy hub for the north-west region of the country. The redeveloped Showgrounds would have a seated capacity of 6000, surpassing all the requirements of a UEFA Category 3 stadium. New floodlights, turnstiles, hospitality spaces, shops, corporate and sponsors facilities, offices, meeting rooms, upgraded media facilities, multiple changing rooms and a gym would be part of the redevelopment.
